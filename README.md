- This project was soooooo easy, and boring
- Passport js did half of the work, liked it
- This is the first time I deployed DB using another services (Neon Console) and deployed express server on Render, since Render only keeps the DB active for 30 days in free tier
- At first I thought that I'd style this project and make it look good unlike the last one, but I'm too lazy to do that, I mean these are BE projects after all
- NOTE: THE SECRET KEY TO JOIN AS A CLUB MEMBER IS - Never gonna give you up

- Finished project on 31/03/2025, it's 00:41AM so technically 30/03 (keep up the good work Lav)
